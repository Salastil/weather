.SH DESCRIPTION
.
This command-line utility is intended to provide quick access to current
weather conditions and forecasts.
.
Presently, it is capable of returning data for localities throughout the
USA and some select locations globally by retrieving and formatting
decoded METARs (Meteorological Aerodrome Reports) from NOAA (the USA
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) and forecasts/alerts
from NWS (the USA National Weather Service).
.
The tool is written to function in the same spirit as other command-line
informational utilities like \fIcal\fR(1), \fIcalendar\fR(1) and
\fIdict\fR(1).
.
It retrieves arbitrary weather data via precompiled correlations or
custom-tailored aliases (system-wide or on a per-user basis).

Behavior can be determined by command-line options and specification of
zero or more location aliases and search terms.

Aliases are defined in \fIweatherrc\fR(5) files, as a convenient means
of grouping URIs together using a short name.
.
Specifying multiple aliases or location search terms on the command line
causes the utility to output data for each, as if it had been invoked
multiple times.
.
If none are specified, then an alias of \fIdefault\fR is checked for a
\fIdefargs\fR option and any alias names listed within it
(comma-separated) are applied instead.

Searches utilize location correlation sets in INI-style text files named
\fIairports\fR, \fIplaces\fR, \fIstations\fR, \fIzctas\fR and
\fIzones\fR.
.
A precomputed copy is distributed with the source, but can be rebuilt
from updated data sources as needed by placing them in the current
working directory and running with the \fI\-\-build\-sets\fR option (see
the comments at the top of any location correlation set file for
instructions on where to find updated data sources).
.
Positive search results are cached and sourced as aliases on subsequent
runs for as long as the correlation sets remain unchanged, and are
cleared automatically once the correlation sets are updated.

Retrieved data is also cached automatically for a short period of time,
adjustable with the \fIcacheage\fR configuration option or
\fI\-\-cacheage\fR command-line option.
.
This helps throttle load against NOAA/NWS servers in case the utility is
repeatedly re-run requesting the same data, but can be overridden with
the \fIcache_data\fR configuration option or \fI\-\-no\-cache\-data\fR
command-line option.

.SH INPUT FILES
.
.B weather
may additionally obtain configuration data from a system-wide
configuration file, a per-user configuration file, and a local
directory configuration file.
.
The file format and configuration options are described in
.IR weatherrc (5).
.
They are aggregated in the following order:
.TP
.I /etc/weatherrc " or " /etc/weather/weatherrc
the system-wide configuration
.TP
.IR ~/.weather/weatherrc " or " ~/.weatherrc
the per-user configuration
.TP
.I ./weatherrc
the local directory configuration
