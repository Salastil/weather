BASIC UNIX INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE WEATHER UTILITY


PREREQUISITES

You need the Python interpreter installed somewhere in your path
(most modern UNIX derivatives come with one already). The weather
executable assumes your Python interpreter is /usr/bin/python so you
may need to edit the #! line if that is not the case. If you need
Python for some reason, it can be obtained from
http://www.python.org/ (but chances are your operating system at
least provides some sort of native package for it, which you should
probably install in whatever means is recommended by your OS
vendor/distributor).


INSTALLING THE UTILITY

The file named weather should be made executable and put somewhere
in your path (/usr/local/bin/ or ~/bin/ for example). Similarly,
weather.py needs to be somewhere in Python's include path. You can
see your Python interpreter's default include path by running:

   python -c "import sys ; print sys.path"


CONFIGURATION

The weatherrc file should go in /etc/ or you can save it in your
home directory as a dotfile (~/.weatherrc) to support user-specific
alias configuration and overrides of the global /etc/weatherrc file.


MANUALS

Optionally, the weather.1 and weatherrc.5 files can be placed in
sane locations for TROFF/NROFF manual files on your system (for
example, /usr/local/share/man/ or ~/man/).
