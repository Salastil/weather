.SH EXAMPLES
The following is an example \fI~/.weather/weatherrc\fR defining a couple
aliases named home and work to be displayed when running the utility
with no aliases specified...
.P
.in 0
.nf
[default]
defargs = home,work

[home]
description = Conditions and Forecast at Home
forecast = True
metar = http://tgftp.nws.noaa.gov/data/observations/metar/decoded/KRDU.TXT
zone_forecast = http://tgftp.nws.noaa.gov/data/forecasts/zone/nc/ncz041.txt

[work]
description = Conditions at Work
metar = http://tgftp.nws.noaa.gov/data/observations/metar/decoded/KGSO.TXT
.fi
.P
Now if
.B weather is invoked by itself on the command line, it will output
conditions for home and work, and also a forecast for home only.
